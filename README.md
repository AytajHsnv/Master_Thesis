## Datasets

### 1. Crack500 dataset
The Crack500 dataset contains 500 images of size around 2000 Ã— 1500 pixels taken by cell phones on main campus of Temple University. And each image was cropped into 16 non-overlapped image regions and only the region containing more than 1000 pixels of crack is kept. Through this way, the training data consists of 1,896 images, validation data contains 348 images, test data contains 1124 images. Download the Crack500 dataset from [this](https://github.com/fyangneil/pavement-crack-detection) link.

            ......
```

### 2. DeepCrack dataset
The DeepCrack dataset is consist of 537 RGB color images with manually annotated segmentations. The images were divided into two main subsets: a training set with 300 images and a testing set with 237 ones. And you can download the Deepcrack dataset from [this](https://github.com/yhlleo/DeepCrack) link. Since deepcrack lacks a validation set, we use its test set as a validation set.
```
|-- DeepCrack
    |-- train
        |-- images
        |   |-- 7Q3A9060-1.jpg
            ......
        |-- masks
        |   |-- 7Q3A9060-1.png
            ......
    |-- test
        |-- images
        |   |-- 11125-1.jpg
            ......
        |-- masks
        |   |-- 11125-1.png
            ......
```

>Before training and testing the model, you can select the dataset you want in [config_crack.yml](https://github.com/HqiTao/CT-crackseg/config_crack.yml) file.

## Training
```python
python train_crack.py
```
And the model will be train for 100 epochs and it will save the best weights for the valiation set.

**Notice:**
***Only the inference code is currently open sourced, the training code will follow once the paper review is finished.***

## Testing
```python
python evaluate.py --output <path_to_dir>
```
It will represent performance measures and will saves related results in `results` folder.
